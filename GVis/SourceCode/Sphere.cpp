             normal of sphere for phi and theta parameter is given by vector (a,b,c).
             Finding normal of sphere surface
             --------------------------------
             1.we have parametric coordinates of sphere as given below-
             x = r*sin(phi)*cos(theta),y = r*sin(phi)*sin(theta),z=r*cos(theta)
             where phi is angle between z-axis and point(x,y,z) and theta is angle between x-axis and
             projectionpoint(x,y,z) in xy plane.r is radius
             so the equation of surface of sphere is represented as-
             
             T = xi + yj + zk
             2.then find  two tangent vectors in suface T which are T(phi) and T(theta) by partial differentiation of T with respect to phi and theta respectively
             
             3.now compute cross product of T(phi) and T(theta) and compute magnitude of resultant cross product.
             
             4.now divide cross product vector by magnitude that gives us unit normal vector which is exactly same as we set below.

             1. we know that theta and phi are the angles which are variable to produce point(x,y,z).so we mapped theta's range which is 0 to 2pi to the width of our 2d texture and similarly phi angle which has range 0 to pi is mapped to height of our 2d texure.
             
             2.if (theta,phi) is equal to (2pi,pi) then resulantant point(x,y,z) will be textured by pixel at (1,1) position of our given 2d texture.if (theta,phi) is equal to (0,0) then resultant (x,y,z) will be texture by pixel at (0,0) position of texture.
